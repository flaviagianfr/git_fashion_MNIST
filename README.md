# git_fashion_MNIST

The project presented is part of the field of artificial intelligence and in particular deals with the problem of image classification. This process uses the  information obtained from the pixel analysis, which represent training examples for the algorithms used. After an initial check of the dataset, the data were transformed into an understandable format, suitable for the needs of the work. Then, different automatic learning models were applied with the aim of identifying the one with the greater prevision accuracy.
The images used in this project represent clothing sold on the Zalando e-commerce. The growth of the phenomenon of online shopping has led to an exponential increase
in the number and variety of products available that can be ordered from the comfort of home. For this reason, the most important e-commerce companies are led to
find solutions to facilitate customer research, for example through the possibility of doing filtered searches for certain product categories.
The classification of images performed in this project aims to direct each product towards the most suitable category.

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset coming from the Kaggle Website of Zalando’s article images—consisting of 70,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated
with a label between 10 classes: 
* T-shirt/top
* Trouser
* Pullover
* Dress
* Coat
* Sandal
* Shirt
* Sneaker
* Bag
* Ankle boot
